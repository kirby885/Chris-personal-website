    <p>You may be wondering why my website is so blue well research says that "The color blue is one of the most popular colors used in design. Both men and women like blue, and the color speaks of trust and calm." <a href="https://designerly.com/what-is-the-best-background-color-for-a-website/#:~:text=White%20is%20not%20only%20the,will%20fade%20into%20the%20background.">link</a>. Also my favorite color so happens to be blue and I belive it to be calming and easy on the eyes.</p>
